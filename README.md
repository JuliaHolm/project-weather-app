# Weather App

This project was a pair project with the focus on using a weather API while also working in branches for the first time with parts of the project. The aim was to build a weather dashboard which displays todays weather aswell as a five day forecast. Different designs were provided that were supposed to be copied as closely as possible.

The design we choose to try to imitate can be seen here for comparison: https://technigo-weagther-app-design-01.netlify.app/

The creators of this weather app is Julia Holm and Anna Robertsson.

## The problem

We created the base for the project together using LiveShare and then split up into branches focusing on sunrise/sunset time and the five day forecast. We experienced a lot of difficulties during the merging process which eventually was solved. It wasn't that much conflicts in the code that needed to be sorted, but there were issues in the terminal when trying to push from one branch. Therefore when the styling branch started to cause problems too we decided to do the styling together in the master branch instead since we didn't want potential issues to take several hours to sort out again.

The local time caused some issues as it with this API doesn't update automatically every second or minute, therefore it doesn't update as frequently as we would like it to. We have researched other APIs and how to update the clock more frequently with a set interval, but it caused some issues with the background images that are supposed to change depending on time of the day. Since we didn't want the clock to get updated from the users device, we decided to keep the clock from the API.

During the project we have worked together to solve issues by discussing, looking through resources online or provided material, and used chatGPT.
